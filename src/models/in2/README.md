# IN2: Assumption Inversion

## Overview

**Model Code:** IN2  
**Model Name:** Assumption Inversion  
**Transformation:** Inversion  
**Tier:** 2  

## Description

The Assumption Inversion model (IN2) is designed to systematically identify, challenge, and invert assumptions to reveal hidden opportunities and risks. By deliberately considering the opposite of what is typically assumed, this model helps uncover blind spots and alternative perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked.

## Key Features

- **Assumption Identification**: Systematically surfaces implicit assumptions in reasoning or decision-making
- **Inversion Analysis**: Examines what would happen if key assumptions were false
- **Opportunity Discovery**: Uncovers hidden opportunities by challenging the status quo
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies potential risks by considering alternative scenarios
- **Perspective Shifting**: Encourages flexible thinking by considering multiple viewpoints

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createAssumptionInversionModel } from './in2';

// Create an instance of the model
const model = createAssumptionInversionModel();

// Analyze a set of assumptions
const analysis = model.analyzeAssumptions({
  context: 'Developing a new product',
  assumptions: [
    'Customers will prefer the new interface',
    'The technology will scale to meet demand',
    'Regulatory requirements will not change significantly',
  ],
});

console.log(analysis);
```

### Inversion Analysis

```typescript
// Perform a detailed inversion analysis
const inversion = model.invertAssumption({
  assumption: 'Customers will prefer the new interface',
  context: 'Mobile app redesign',
  confidence: 0.8,
});

console.log('Inversion results:', inversion);
```

## API Reference

### `createAssumptionInversionModel(config?)`

Creates a new instance of the Assumption Inversion model.

**Parameters:**
- `config` (Optional): Configuration object for the model

**Returns:** A model instance with the following methods:
- `analyzeAssumptions(params)`: Analyzes a set of assumptions
- `invertAssumption(params)`: Inverts a single assumption for analysis
- `generateCounterExamples(assumption)`: Generates counter-examples to challenge an assumption
- `evaluateImpact(inversion)`: Evaluates the potential impact of an inverted assumption

### Types

```typescript
interface Assumption {
  id: string;
  statement: string;
  context: string;
  confidence: number;
  source?: string;
  tags?: string[];
}

interface AssumptionAnalysis {
  assumptions: Assumption[];
  inverted: Array<{
    original: Assumption;
    inverted: string;
    impact: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    confidence: number;
    counterExamples: string[];
  }>;
  summary: {
    totalAssumptions: number;
    highImpactInversions: number;
    averageConfidence: number;
  };
}

interface InversionResult {
  originalAssumption: Assumption;
  invertedStatement: string;
  confidence: number;
  impact: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  counterExamples: string[];
  potentialRisks: string[];
  potentialOpportunities: string[];
  mitigationStrategies: string[];
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Critical Assumptions**: Focus on assumptions that have the highest potential impact
2. **Encourage Diverse Perspectives**: Involve team members with different backgrounds
3. **Quantify When Possible**: Assign confidence levels and impact scores to prioritize
4. **Document Inversions**: Keep a record of inverted assumptions and their implications
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically revisit and challenge assumptions as conditions change

## Examples

### Product Development

**Assumption:** "Users want more features in our application."

**Inversion:** "Users want fewer, simpler features in our application."

**Potential Insights:**
- Some users may be overwhelmed by feature bloat
- There might be an opportunity to create a 'lite' version
- Core functionality might be getting lost among less-used features

### Business Strategy

**Assumption:** "Our main competitor will continue to focus on the enterprise market."

**Inversion:** "Our main competitor will shift focus to the SMB market."

**Potential Implications:**
- Need to strengthen SMB value proposition
- May need to adjust pricing or packaging
- Could indicate an opportunity in the enterprise space
