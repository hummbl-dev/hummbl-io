# P1 - First Principles Framing

## Overview
First Principles Framing is a foundational model in the HUMMBL framework that enables breaking down complex problems into their most basic, foundational elements to create innovative solutions. As the first model in the Perspective/Identity (P) transformation, it establishes the fundamental approach for problem-solving across the entire framework.

## Key Characteristics
- **Analytical reduction to fundamentals**: Breaks down problems to their core components
- **Removes layers of assumptions**: Identifies and challenges underlying assumptions
- **Identifies irreducible truths**: Distills problems to their most basic truths
- **Rebuilds understanding from foundation up**: Constructs solutions based on fundamental principles

## Practical Example

### Problem
Redesigning a pricing strategy

### Traditional Approach
Benchmarking against competitors (derivative thinking)

### First Principles Approach
1. **Decompose the problem**:
   - What are the fundamental costs?
   - What is the value to the customer?
   - What are the market constraints?

2. **Identify assumptions**:
   - Assumption about customer price sensitivity
   - Assumption about competitor pricing strategies
   - Assumption about cost structures

3. **Establish fundamental truths**:
   - Raw material costs: $X/unit
   - Manufacturing costs: $Y/unit
   - Desired profit margin: Z%

4. **Rebuild the solution**:
   - Calculate base price from fundamentals
   - Validate against market constraints
   - Optimize based on value delivery

## Implementation

### Installation
```bash
# If not already installed
npm install @hummbl/models
```

### Usage
```typescript
import { createFirstPrinciplesModel, applyFirstPrinciples } from '@hummbl/models/p1';

// Create a model instance
const model = createFirstPrinciplesModel();

// Use individual methods
const problem = 'How can we reduce production costs while maintaining quality?';
const decomposed = model.methods.decomposeProblem(problem);
const assumptions = model.methods.identifyAssumptions(problem);
const truths = model.methods.extractFundamentalTruths(problem);
const solution = model.methods.rebuildSolution(truths);

// Or use the convenience function
const analysis = applyFirstPrinciples(problem);
console.log(analysis.solution);
```

## API Reference

### `createFirstPrinciplesModel()`
Creates a new instance of the First Principles model.

**Returns**: `FirstPrinciplesModel` - The model instance with all methods.

### `applyFirstPrinciples(problem: string): FirstPrinciplesAnalysis`
Applies first principles thinking to a problem.

**Parameters**:
- `problem` (string): The problem statement to analyze

**Returns**: `FirstPrinciplesAnalysis` - An object containing:
  - `problem`: The original problem
  - `decomposed`: Array of decomposed problem elements
  - `assumptions`: Array of identified assumptions
  - `fundamentalTruths`: Array of extracted truths
  - `solution`: The derived solution

## Related Models
- **P15**: Assumption Surfacing - Identifies and challenges assumptions
- **DE1**: Root Cause Analysis - Complements problem decomposition
- **IN3**: Problem Reversal - Alternative approach to problem-solving

## Best Practices
1. **Start with a clear problem statement**
   - Be specific about what you're trying to solve
   - Avoid solutioning in the problem statement

2. **Be ruthless in decomposition**
   - Break down until you reach irreducible truths
   - Challenge every assumption, no matter how fundamental it seems

3. **Document your process**
   - Keep track of assumptions and how they were validated
   - Document the fundamental truths you identify

4. **Rebuild incrementally**
   - Start with the simplest possible solution
   - Add complexity only when necessary
   - Validate each addition against fundamental truths
