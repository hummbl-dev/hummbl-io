# Changelog

All notable changes to the First Principles Framing (P1) model will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- Initial implementation of First Principles Framing (P1) model
- Core functionality for problem decomposition and solution building
- Telemetry integration for performance monitoring
- Comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage
- Example implementations and documentation

### Features
- `analyze()`: Main method for processing problems using first principles
- Event-driven architecture for extensibility
- `configure()`: Update model configuration at runtime
- `getConfig()`: Get current configuration
- Event emission for important lifecycle events

### Known Issues
- **Test Suite**: 4/24 tests currently failing (non-critical)
  - Event emission tests expect legacy event names (will be updated in v1.1.0)

- Various AI provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere) testing and building

### Known Limitations
- Current implementation uses placeholder AI logic that needs to be connected to actual AI services
- Telemetry storage and visualization not yet implemented
- Limited to text-based input/output in initial version

### Security
- API key management required for production use
- Input validation in place to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting recommended at the API gateway level
