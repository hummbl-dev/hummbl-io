# Chat AI Integration Enhancements

## Overview

Enhanced the chat functionality with intelligent mental models integration, better error handling, and export capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Intelligent Context Builder (`contextualPromptBuilder.ts`)

- **Conversation Analysis**: Automatically extracts topics, complexity, and intent from conversations
- **Smart Model Suggestions**: Analyzes conversation content to suggest relevant mental models
- **Relevance Scoring**: Scores models based on topic matching and intent alignment
- **Dynamic Prompt Building**: Creates context-aware prompts that reference specific models

**Key Features:**

- Extracts up to 5 key topics from conversation
- Detects complexity (simple/moderate/complex)
- Identifies user intent (explore/solve/learn/compare/apply)
- Suggests top 5 most relevant models with reasoning
- Generates application suggestions for each model

### 2. Enhanced OpenAI Service

- **Increased Model Context**: Shows up to 20 models instead of 10 for better coverage
- **Better Model Information**: Includes model code alongside name and definition
- **Extended Descriptions**: Shows up to 150 characters of definition instead of 100
- **Improved Instructions**: AI now instructed to reference specific models by name

### 3. Model Suggestions Component (`ModelSuggestions.tsx`)

- **Visual Suggestions**: Beautiful gradient card showing relevant mental models
- **Relevance Display**: Shows relevance score and reasoning for each suggestion
- **Application Guidance**: Provides specific suggestions on how to apply each model
- **Interactive**: Users can click to use suggested models in conversation
- **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

### 4. Improved Error Handling (`ChatError.tsx`)

- **Contextual Guidance**: Provides specific help based on error type
- **Visual Indicators**: Different styles for error/warning/info
- **Retry Functionality**: Quick retry button for transient errors
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Translates technical errors into actionable guidance
- **Error Types Handled**:
  - API key issues
  - Rate limiting
  - Network problems
  - Timeout errors

### 5. Conversation Export Service (`conversationExport.ts`)

- **Multiple Formats**: Export to Markdown, Plain Text, or JSON
- **Configurable Options**: Include/exclude timestamps and metadata
- **Download Support**: Direct file download functionality
- **Clipboard Copy**: One-click copy to clipboard
- **Smart Filenames**: Auto-generates meaningful filenames with timestamps

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Conversation Analysis

```typescript
const analysis = contextualBuilder.analyzeConversation(conversation);
// Returns: { topics, complexity, intent, suggestedModels }
```

### 2. Model Suggestion Flow

1. User sends a message
2. System analyzes conversation for topics and intent
3. Scores available mental models for relevance
4. Returns top 5 suggestions with reasoning
5. UI displays suggestions for user to explore

### 3. Enhanced System Prompt

- Includes conversation analysis
- Lists suggested relevant models
- Provides model definitions and applications
- Instructs AI to reference specific models

### 4. Export Workflow

- User selects export format
- System generates appropriate format
- Downloads as file or copies to clipboard
- Filename includes conversation title and date

## üìä Impact

### Before

- Limited to 10 mental models in context
- No model suggestions
- Basic error messages
- No export functionality
- Generic system prompts

### After

- 20 models in context for better coverage
- Intelligent model suggestions based on conversation
- Contextual error handling with guidance
- Export to multiple formats
- Dynamic, conversation-aware prompts

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Using Model Suggestions

```typescript
import { getContextualBuilder } from '../services/contextualPromptBuilder';

const contextualBuilder = getContextualBuilder(mentalModels);
const analysis = contextualBuilder.analyzeConversation(conversation);
// Use analysis.suggestedModels to display suggestions
```

### Exporting Conversations

```typescript
import { conversationExport } from '../services/conversationExport';

// Export to Markdown
await conversationExport.downloadConversation(conversation, {
  format: 'markdown',
  includeTimestamp: true,
  includeMetadata: true,
});

// Copy to clipboard
await conversationExport.copyToClipboard(conversation, 'text');
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
import { ChatError } from './ChatError';

<ChatError
  error={error}
  onDismiss={() => setError(null)}
  onRetry={handleRetry}
  type="error"
/>
```

## üìù Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Integrate Model Suggestions into ChatWidget**: Add the `ModelSuggestions` component to the chat UI
2. **Add Export Button**: Add export functionality to the chat settings
3. **Real-time Suggestions**: Update suggestions as conversation evolves
4. **Model Application Tracking**: Track which models users are applying

## üéØ Benefits

- **Better User Experience**: More relevant suggestions and helpful error messages
- **Increased Engagement**: Users discover relevant models during conversation
- **Knowledge Retention**: Export conversations for reference
- **Improved Understanding**: AI references specific models by name
- **Scalability**: Smarter context means fewer tokens while improving quality
