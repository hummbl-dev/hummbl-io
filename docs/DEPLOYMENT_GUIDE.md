Step-by-step workflow for:
- Running quality checks (lint, type-check, build)
- Committing with proper messages
- Creating pull requests
- Merging to main
- Verifying Vercel deployment
- Emergency rollback procedures

**Impact**: Cascade can execute complete deployment cycles autonomously.

### 3. `.windsurf/workflows/add-new-model.md`
**Model Addition Workflow**

Complete procedure for:
- Creating model JSON files
- Building model page components
- Configuring routes
- Updating navigation
- Testing and validation
- Publishing checklist

**Impact**: Reduces 30-minute manual process to 2-minute automated workflow.

### 4. `ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Impact**: Helps you maintain and evolve the context system over time.

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Copy Files to HUMMBL Project

```bash
# Navigate to your hummbl-io repository
cd /path/to/hummbl-io

# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p .windsurf/rules
mkdir -p .windsurf/workflows

# Copy files from outputs to project
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/.windsurf/rules/global.md .windsurf/rules/
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/.windsurf/workflows/deploy-feature.md .windsurf/workflows/
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/.windsurf/workflows/add-new-model.md .windsurf/workflows/
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/ARCHITECTURE.md docs/
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/PATTERNS.md docs/
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md docs/
cp /mnt/user-data/outputs/CONTEXT_README.md docs/
```

### Step 2: Verify File Structure

Your project should now have:

```
hummbl-io/
├── .windsurf/
│   ├── rules/
│   │   └── global.md
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── deploy-feature.md
│       └── add-new-model.md
├── docs/
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── PATTERNS.md
│   ├── PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
│   ├── CONTEXT_README.md
│   └── [other existing docs]
└── [rest of project files]
```

### Step 3: Commit to Repository

```bash
# Stage all new context files
git add .windsurf/ docs/

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "docs(context): add Windsurf/Cascade context engineering system

- Add global coding standards (rules/global.md)
- Add deployment and model workflows
- Document architecture and code patterns
- Create project context quick reference
- Add context system README

These documents enable AI agents (especially Cascade) to understand
HUMMBL's conventions, patterns, and workflows for better code generation."

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Reload Windsurf

```bash
# In Windsurf IDE
# Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux)
# Type: "Reload Window"
# Press Enter

# OR: Close and reopen Windsurf completely
```

**Important**: Windsurf must reload to discover the new `.windsurf/` directory.

### Step 5: Test Context Integration

Open Cascade (Cmd+L / Ctrl+L) and try these test prompts:

**Test 1: Check Rules Awareness**
```
You: "What coding standards should I follow for HUMMBL?"
Cascade: [Should reference global.md and list key conventions]
```

**Test 2: Check Workflow Awareness**
```
You: "How do I add a new model to HUMMBL?"
Cascade: [Should reference add-new-model.md workflow]
```

**Test 3: Check Architecture Awareness**
```
You: "What's the directory structure for components?"
Cascade: [Should reference ARCHITECTURE.md]
```

**Test 4: Check Pattern Awareness**
```
You: "Show me how to create a TransformationBadge component"
Cascade: [Should follow patterns from PATTERNS.md and global.md]
```

If Cascade references these documents in responses, **context integration successful!** ✅

## Immediate Benefits

### Before Context Documents

**Scenario**: "Add model P2"

```
You: "Add model P2"
Cascade: "Where should I create the file?"
You: "/public/models/"
Cascade: "What structure should the JSON have?"
You: [Explains model structure]
Cascade: [Creates file]
Cascade: "Should I create a page for it?"
You: "Yes, follow the P1 pattern"
Cascade: [Creates page, but misses route config]
You: "Add the route"
Cascade: [Adds route]
You: "Update navigation"
Cascade: [Updates navigation]
[15 minutes of back-and-forth]
```

### After Context Documents

**Scenario**: "Add model P2"

```
You: "Add model P2"
Cascade: [Reads add-new-model.md workflow]
Cascade: "Creating P2 model following the standard workflow:
         
         1. Creating /public/models/P2.json with Base120 structure
         2. Creating /src/pages/models/P2Page.tsx component
         3. Adding route to App.tsx
         4. Updating navigation in ModelNavigation.tsx
         5. Adding to search index
         
         Following TypeScript strict mode and component patterns
         from global.md. Using P transformation color (#3B82F6).
         
         [Implements all steps correctly]
         
         Model P2 created and integrated. Ready to test at /models/P2."

- Doesn't follow workflows

**Solutions:**
1. Verify files in correct locations (.windsurf/, docs/)
2. Reload Windsurf window (Cmd+Shift+P → "Reload Window")
3. Explicitly reference: "Follow the pattern in PATTERNS.md"
4. Check file permissions (must be readable)

### Conflicting Instructions

**Symptoms:**
- Cascade seems confused
- Inconsistent behavior
- Asks which approach to follow

**Solutions:**
1. Search for contradictions across documents
2. Prioritize: global.md > PATTERNS.md > other docs
3. Update conflicting sections for consistency
4. Add clarifying notes where ambiguity necessary

### Out-of-Date Documentation

**Symptoms:**
- Examples don't match current code
- References to removed features
- Deprecated patterns suggested

**Solutions:**
1. Set calendar reminder for monthly reviews
2. Update docs as part of PR process
3. Add "Last Updated" timestamps to sections
4. Use version numbers for major changes

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Rules for Features

Create feature-specific rules:

```bash
# Example: API-specific rules
.windsurf/rules/api.md

# Example: Testing-specific rules
.windsurf/rules/testing.md
```

Cascade loads all rules in `.windsurf/rules/` directory.

### Workflow Templates

Create templates for common tasks:

```bash
.windsurf/workflows/templates/
├── component-template.md
├── feature-template.md
└── integration-template.md
```

Reference in workflows: "See template in workflows/templates/"

### Integration with MCP

Model Context Protocol servers can extend Cascade's capabilities:

```json
// .windsurf/mcp.json
{
  "servers": {
    "hummbl-context": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "description": "HUMMBL-specific context server"
    }
  }
}
```
